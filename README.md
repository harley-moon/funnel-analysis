# funnel-analysis
This project uses SQL to complete a funnel analysis and to calculate conversion rates for a fictional online eyeglass retailer. This analysis generates insights that allow stakeholders to optimize the functionality and effectiveness of their marketing funnels.
 
The store defines their two marketing funnels as follows:
* Style Quiz Funnel: Q1 → Q2 → Q3 → Q4 → Q5
* Home Try-On Funnel: Style Quiz → Home Try-On → Purchase
  
The following tables were used for this analysis:
* Survey (style quiz questions and user responses)
* Quiz (user responses to style quiz) 
* Home Try-On (user home try-on details)
* Purchase (user purchase details)
